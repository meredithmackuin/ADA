This web application was written for a previous employer in 2015 and to my knowledge has not ever been put into production; when I left there was no one else on my team with the abilities to support it (despite my copious commenting) and no other team was willing to support it when they themselves had not written it.  

After removing my employer's identifying terms, I am providing it here as an example of my work.  The form itself is 100% my own work; the datePicker.js has been modified only slightly and at the time of publication the datePicker.css has not been modified at all.
